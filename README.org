#+title: Compal CH7465LG tools in Common Lisp
#+startup: hidestars

Part of my personal home automation efforts.

Done mostly by manual reverse-engineering of the protocol, but I also took a look at [[https://github.com/ties/compal_CH7465LG_py][Python tools for this modem line]].

* Status
  I'm just starting to work on it. The goal is to implement the following set of functionality:
  - fetching a list of all devices connected to the network
  - whatever else I'll end up needing for my home automation setup

* How to use

  To be written.

* Contributions

  Pull requests always welcome :).
